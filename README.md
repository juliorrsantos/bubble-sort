# Bublle Sort

## A simple C implementation of the bubble sort c algorithm.

- The main.c file contains an example of use for the function.  
- It was also implemented a function to print the values of the vector, just for watching what's going on.
- You can see every vector iteraction by uncommenting the folowing line on "bubble-sort.c" file:  
```//printVect(vect, len);```
